KERMIT 95 SOURCE FILES

     Most recent update:  Wed Apr 9 10:56:06 2014

   The source code collection described below turns out to be incomplete. As
   of November 2013, a new set of sources that can be compiled into a
   functional new Open Source version of Kermit 95 are under construction.

   As part of the cancellation of the Kermit Project, the source code for
   Kermit 95 (K95 for short, the Kermit software for 32-bit and 64-bit
   versions of Microsoft Windows and for IBM OS/2, which previously was
   available only as a commercial product) is being published for the first
   time under the open-source Revised 3-Clause BSD License so that
   anybody who wants to can download, build, customize, embed, package,
   redistribute, or do anything else with it that is legal and permitted by
   the license. It is hoped that this will result in the Open Source
   community creating a new and free version of Kermit 95. In the meantime,
   those who still need a ready-to-run Kermit 95 application can obtain it
   from the retailers listed on the Kermit 95 homepage, and those who need
   bulk licenses can obtain them from Columbia Technology Ventures.

   The new kermit95 directory in the Kermit software archive now contains
   the Columbia-written source files for Kermit 95 2.1.3, released 1 January
   2003, with updates by Jeffrey Altman through 2007.

   This source code does not include the various libraries with which K95 is
   linked, notably MIT Kerberos and OpenSSL. Those libraries have
   undergone considerable change and development since K95 2.1.3 was
   released, and any new release of K95 should be adapted to the current
   releases (use buttons at top).

   The modules which are shared with C-Kermit for Unix, VMS, and other
   platforms (ckc*.*, cku*.*) correspond to those of C-Kermit 8.0.207 (which
   was never formally released), but with updates either from the main
   C-Kermit development branch, or K95-specific by Jeff. No attempt has been
   made to reconcile these sources with those of C-Kermit 9.0; that would
   be a big job indeed (but one that is worth doing if a new Open Source
   Kermit 95 release is to be created). Only the minimum changes to convert
   the K95 source code to an Open Source license have been made:

     * A new COPYING.TXT file.

     * New copyright notices in ckcmai.c (the K95 main program module).

     * Elimination of restrictive license text from all files that are
       Copyright Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York
       (these files have 19 July 2011 modification dates). The COPYING.TXT
       file applies to all files in this directory bearing a Columbia
       University copyright.

     * Exclusion of any module whose license prohibits open distribution
       (primarily the XYZMODEM code).

   No attempt has been made to compile or link these source files on Windows
   or OS/2 or anywhere else (actually I did attempt it, but did not get very
   far; see below).

   Any new version of K95 will have to deal with the following
   considerations:

     * A new (non-Installshield) installer is needed.

     * Many bugs need to be addressed.

     * Large file support should be added (K95 uses 32-bit C Library APIs for
       file access). C-Kermit itself supports large files so it's "just" a
       matter of changing the file i/o routines in ckofio.c (?).

     * All registration, serial number, and license enforcement code should
       be removed.

     * There can be no Dialer unless a new one is written from scratch. The
       Dialer was built using a commercial GUI-builder called Zinc; that
       company ceased to exist many years ago. Columbia had a source license
       to Zinc and made modifications and bug fixes necessary to build the
       Dialer. But Columbia does not have the right to distribute Zinc nor
       any patches to it.

     * If there is no Dialer, the Dialer activation button should be removed
       from the K95G.EXE Toolbar.

     * The Console version for Windows is obsolete since later Windows
       versions do not support it; only the GUI version (K95G.EXE) should be
       built. Also there is probably not much reason to carry forward support
       for Windows 95, 98, and ME.

     * The XYZMODEM protocol code was contributed from a company in Finland.
       The license under which this code was included in Kermit 95 forbids
	   publication of the source code.

     * The SSH code contains known security weaknesses that need to be fixed.
       K95's SSH module was adapted from a 2002 version of OpenSSH, but
       OpenSSH itself has changed so much since then that a new SSH module
       should be developed from scratch. In any case the crypto code in
       Kermit 95 was granted an export license after an explicit
       classification review. Columbia University (with which the Kermit
       Project is no longer affiliated) did not follow up with the US
       Government for permission to open-source the code derived from
       OpenSSH; therefore it can't be published. Most likely SSH will be
       reintroduced into the Kermit 95 by adapting PuTTY's Plink program,
       which is permissible now that Kermit 95 is Open Source itself.

     * Other security code (Kerberos, SSL/TLS, and SRP) needs to brought up
       to date with current releases of those libraries.

     * To take advantage of all the new developments in C-Kermit since 2003
       and to return to a common code base for C-Kermit and K95, K95 should
       be integrated with the C-Kermit source files (ck[cu]*.[ch] and
       ckcpro.w).

   K95 was last built with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0. Some adaptation may
   be required to build it with current Microsoft developers tools and/or
   non-Microsoft tools.

   K95-specific source files have names starting with "cko" and "ckn". These
   files were not written to be read by the public so in some cases comments
   might be inexistent, sketchy, or misleading.

   The makefile is ckoker.mak. Before running it, it's necessary to set
   the "include" and "lib" environment variables for the external libraries
   K95 is linked with (such as OpenSSL, SRP, and Kerberos), for example [each
   of these is one long line broken for readability]:

     set include=%include%;c:\src\kermit\k95;
   c:\src\openssl\0.9.7\inc32;
   c:\src\srp\include;
   c:\src\pwsdk\inc32;
   c:\src\kerberos\kfw-2.2-beta-2\athena\wshelper\include;
   c:\src\superlat\include;
   c:\src\kerberos\kfw-2.2-beta-2\athena\auth\krb5\src\include;
   c:\src\kermit\k95\kui;
   c:\src\zinc\include;

     set lib=%lib%;c:\src\kerberos\kfw-2.2-beta-2\target\lib\i386\rel;
   c:\src\zinc\lib\mvcpp500

   Note that Zinc is not included in this distribution, nor Meridian
   Technologies SuperLAT, support for which was included in K95 under
   license. Any -DSUPERLAT definition should be removed the makefile. I'm not
   sure how avoid Zinc. Once the lib and include environments are defined,
   the makefile can be invoked something like this:

   SET PLATFORM=NT
   SET K95BUILD=K95
   nmake /nologo /e /f ckoker.mak msvc |& tee comp.out.nt | list /s

   In the source code and makefile you will see many references to "KUI".
   This was a 100% graphical version of K95 that was never completed. The
   sources contain a fair amount of vestigial KUI code.

   The principal authors of Kermit 95, Jeff Altman and Frank da Cruz, no
   longer have jobs at Columbia University and may or may not be available
   for advice due to the exigencies of real life.

  Appendix: Directory Structure

   The makefile ckoker.mak assumes data files for Kermit 95 are in a
   directory tree (lowercase names are directories):

     * Root (name doesn't matter)

          * SETENV.BAT - Defines the "include" and "lib" environment
            variables
          * infozip - Zip and Unzip sources and binaries (not used in build)
          * kerberos - Kerberos for Windows sources, libraries, and utilities
          * kermit - Kermit 95 source files

               * cif - k95_21_master.cif file used in creating CD image (not
                 used in build)
               * dialer - source code for K95 Dialer (not released because
                 there is no way to build it)
               * k95 - Source code for Kermit 95 itself, plus .BAT files for
                 launching builds of various configurations, plus the
                 following subdirectories:

                    * iksd - Directory used for object files when building
                      WIKSD
                    * kui - Directory used for object files for building KUI
                      (see above)
                    * nt - Directory for building Kermit 95
                    * ssh - OpenSSH libraries and other materials
                    * k95dlls - Example of how to create a K95 DLL (not used
                      in build)
                    * k95inst - Files used in K95 installer and registration
                      (not used in build)
                    * p - Original XYZMODEM code Oy Online Solutions Ltd
                      including license
                    * p95 - XYZMODEM code modified for use in K95

          * openssl - OpenSSL
          * pwsdk - Digital Equipment Corporation PATHWORKS Software
            Developers Kit
          * srp - Stanford Secure Remote Password libraries
          * superlat - Meridian Technologies SuperLAT
          * zinc - the Zinc GUI developer

   Using this arrangement, you could first CD to the root directory, execute
   SETENV.BAT, then CD to the Kermit subdirectory, then CD to the k95
   directory and execute the makefile.

   I tried this myself with mknt.bat, but evidently these batch files are to
   be used with some other shell than CMD.EXE because it fails with "& was
   not expected at this time". Giving the nmake command without the
   redirectors:

     nmake /nologo /e /f ckoker.mak msvc

   failed because nmake wasn't found. I located it in:

     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\nmake.exe

   and set my PATH accordingly, tried the nmake command again but it failed
   with "mspdb60.dll not found" and advised me to "reinstall". I'm not a
   Windows programmer, so that's as far as I got. If I obtain any new
   information, I will improve these instructions.
