/*
INSTRUCTIONS

Compile and load the program in each of the following ways:

   $ cc -DANYBSD -DSAVEDUID -o ckuuid1 ckuuid.c            (1)
   $ cc -DANYBSD -o ckuuid2 ckuuid.c                       (2)
   $ cc -DANYBSD -DNOSETREU -o ckuuid3 ckuuid.c            (3)
   $ cc -DANYBSD -DSETEUID -DNOSETREU -o ckuuid5 ckuuid.c  (4)
   $ cc -o ckuuid4 ckuuid.c                                (5)

(1) is for Berkeley-based systems that have setregid() and setreuid() and that
    have the saved-original-effective-uid feature, similar to AT&T System V.

(2) is for Berkeley-based systems that have setregid and setreuid, but do not
    have the saved-original-effective-uid feature.

(3) is for Berkeley-based systems that don't have setregid() and setreuid().

(4) is for BSD4.4 and others that have seteuid()/setegid() and
    saved-original-effective-uid feature.

(5) is for all others, including all AT&T-based versions, Xenix, etc.

After building the program, run it to make sure that the uid's don't change
(they shouldn't if the program is not setuid'd).

Now make the program setuid and setgid to someone else, e.g.:

   $ su
   Password: xxxx
   su% chown uucp.uucp ckuuid2
   su% chmod ug+s ckuuid2
   su% exit

and then run it, recording the results.  Give the name of a directory (not a
regular file) that you should have write-access to on the command line, e.g.:

   $ script
   $ who am i
   $ ls -lg ./ckuuid2
   $ ./ckuuid2 .
   $ exit

Read the output and make sure that the uids and gids can be changed back
and forth.

In steps 2, 4, and 5, check to see if access() worked correctly when you
have privs turned off.  If it doesn't, try recompiling with -DSW_ACC_ID
(swap IDs for access()) and repeat the above procedure.

Please report the results (mail the typescript file) back to me,
fdc@columbia.edu, letting me know exactly what kind of machine you
have, and which version of UNIX.

Subject: Set-user-id
To: fdc@watsun.cc.columbia.edu (Frank da Cruz)

From: Kristoffer Eriksson <ske@pkmab.se>

This is a set of functions to be used in programs that may be run set-user-id
and/or set-group-id. They handle both the case where the program is not run
with such privileges (nothing special happens then), and the case where one
or both of these set-id modes are used.  The program is made to run with the
user's real user and group ids most of the time, except for when more
privileges are needed.  Don't set-user-id to "root".

This works on System V and POSIX.  In BSD, it depends on the
"saved-set-user-id" feature.
*/

/* Called as early as possible in a set-uid or set-gid program to store the
 * set-to uid and/or gid and step down to the users real uid and gid. The
 * stored id's can be temporarily restored (allowed in System V) during
 * operations that require the privilege.  Most of the time, the program
 * should execute in unpriviliged state, to not impose any security threat.
 *
 * Note: Don't forget that access() always uses the real id:s to determine
 * file access, even with privileges restored.
 *
 * Returns an error mask, with error values or:ed together:
 *   1 if setuid() fails,
 *   2 if setgid() fails, and
 *   4 if the program is set-user-id to "root", which can't be handled.
 *
 * Only the return value 0 indicates real success. In case of failure,
 * those privileges that could be reduced have been, at least, but the
 * program should be halted nonetheless.
 *
 * Also note that these functions do not expect the uid or gid to change
 * without their knowing. It may work if it is only done temporarily, but
 * you're on your own.

     * 1) If the real uid is already "root" and the set-uid uid (the
     * initial effective uid) is not "root", then we would have trouble
     * if we went "down" to "root" here, and then temporarily back to the
     * set-uid uid (not "root") and then again tried to become "root". I
     * think the "saved set-uid" is lost when changing uid from effective
     * uid "root", which changes all uid, not only the effective uid. But
     * in this situation, we can simply go to "root" and stay there all
     * the time. That should give sufficient privilege (understatement!),
     * and give the right uids for subprocesses.
     *
     * 2) If the set-uid (the initial effective uid) is "root", and we
     * change uid to the real uid, we can't change it back to "root" when
     * we need the privilege, for the same reason as in 1). Thus, we can't
     * handle programs that are set-user-id to "root" at all. The program
     * should be halted.  Use some other uid. "root" is probably too
     * privileged for such things, anyway.  (The uid is reverted to the
     * real uid for the lifetime of the program.)
     *
     * These two exceptions have the effect that the "root" uid will never
     * be one of the two uids that are being switched between, which also
     * means we don't have to check for such cases in the switching
     * functions.
     *
     * Note that exception 1) is handled by these routines (by constantly
     * running with uid "root", while exception 2) is a serious error, and
     * is not provided for at all in the switching functions.

/* Turn off privilege permanently.  No going back.  This is necessary before
 * a fork() on BSD43 machines that don't save the setUID or setGID, because
 * we swap the real and effective ids, and we don't want to let the forked
 * process swap them again and get the privilege back. It will work on other
 * machines too, such that you can rely on its effect always being the same,
 * for instance, even when you're in priv_on() state when this is called.
 * (Well, that part about "permanent" is on System V only true if you follow
 * this with a call to exec(), but that's what we want it for anyway.)
