The following is an unordered bullet list of bug fixes and new features
which have been added to Kermit 95 since the last release from Columbia
University in January 2003.  For a more complete description of the 
changes see the Kermit 95 New Bugs file which can be found at

  ftp://ftp.columbia.edu/kermit/k95/newbugs.txt

  * Fixed a bug preventing the execution of macros assigned to keys or
    mouse events when in terminal mode
  * added DG4xx Set Cursor Type sequence  <RS> F Q <type>
  * the dialer did not save the values of menubar, toolbar, statusbar
    settings on the gui page
  * a SEND command embedded in a macro and executed as a function with
    \Fexecute(macro) would cause K95 to crash
  * timeouts were added to incoming tcp/ip server sockets to prevent
    denial of service attacks
  * the passphrase dialog box for private keys accessed during SSL/TLS
    did not obscure passphrase input

    now the default

  * Corrections to the AnnArbor terminal emulation handling of zSDP
  * UNC paths now supported for FTP operations
  * the dialer's QUICK command now supports connections based on
    templates and includes a SaveAs operation (a poor man's clone)
  * Linux Character Set handling fixed

    session removed

  * a handle leak in the IKSD Service was plugged
  * new SET FTP BUG USE_SSL_V2 {ON, OFF} command
  * new SET SSH HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL <seconds> command
  * new ON_CD macro.  This macro is executed (if defined) whenever a
    change directory operation occurs.
  * added FTP MLSD parsing of extended strings
  * added SET ATTRIBUTES DATE OFF support for XYZmodem transfers
  * improved algorithm for calculating optimal number of overlapped
    I/O operations on serial connections
  * Improvements to Kerberos 5 support
  * Fixed FTP ASCII sends

  * SET DIALER BACKSPACE now clears the equivalent SET KEY and SET
    TERM KEY values
  * When reading strings from the Windows registry, environment
    variables are now expanded
  * fixed the ability to disable reverse dns lookups
  * fixed code that checks if a name is a directory to work on network
    mapped file systems which do not provide creation date information
    for directories.
  * added missing keymap assignments for IBM 3151 emulation
  * the dialer did not preserve alternative port numbers for FTP connections
  * removed a Windows Event Log entry logged before the IKSD.KSC file could
    be processed to disable all logging
  * HyperLink Extensions were added to ANSI based terminals allowing URLs and
    UNCs to be specified within the terminal stream just like HREFs work in
    HTML
  * Fixed improper handling of DCS sequences consisting of an intermediary
    '$' character
  * Add SET TELNET BUG AUTH-KRB5-DES which defaults to ON.  When OFF, 3DES
    encryption may be used with KRB5 Telnet authentication.
  * Replaced C runtime library stat() calls with home grown version to allow
    for proper processing of UNCs in file transfer operations 
  * Allow SET TITLE input to be surrounded by braces
  * Implemented {SEND, RECEIVE} {MOVE-TO, RENAME-TO} for XYZmodem transfers
  * Fixed SEND /MOVE-TO:directory file transfers
  * Fixed SET TERMINAL DEBUG ON
  * Fixed BEEP INFORMATION (and any events that trigger an Informational 
    audible notification)
  * Removed restriction of FTP GSSAPI exchanges limiting them to one 
    round-trip
  * Rebuilt all binaries with the new Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 
    compiler.  The primary benefits are optimizations and security 
    precautions.
  * Fixed a bug preventing (CSI Z) backtab from being executed.
  * Add a GUI dialog version of the TYPE command to K95G
  * SCO SGR Set fg/bg colors hack  (CSI 2;fg;bg m)  The implementation 
    set the colors to black on black regardless to what was specified
  * SCO Set Function Key hack (ESC Q fn quote ... quote)
    If the <fn> character is below '0', don't throw it away; instead
    push the character back into the input stream and reprocess it.
  * IBM EDI Services fails randomly due to a "missing tmp rsa export
    key" error.
  * Fixed incorrect script generation by the dialer when Transaction
    Logging was turned on.  The SET TRANSACTION-LOG command was 
    incompletely generated.
  * Named Pipe connections (both client and server side) have been added.
  * Fixed when SET FTP CHARACTER-SET-TRANSLATION ON, output from the FTP DIR
    and FTP TYPE commands would output as garbage
  * Fixed the parsing of the FTP FEAT response
  * Fixed Dialer Generated FTP Connection Scripts to perform login in a
    script safe manner.
  * Fixed Dialer Generated FTP Connection Scripts to include commands 
    specified as part of the Login page textbox
  * Fixed Unique file name generation when the file system is 8.3 (FAT)
    restricted and the original filename only contains an extension.
  * Added SET MSKERMIT FILE-RENAMING {ON, OFF} which enables the use of
    the MS-DOS Kermit file collision unique name generation algorithm
    instead of the C-Kermit algorithm.
  * Applied the SET EXIT STATUS value to the termination of K95G via [x]
  * Fixed a bug in K95G which prevented proper recognition of mouse drag
    events when either the Shift or Ctrl keys were pressed.
  * Fixed FTP SITE HELP to output response text even when verbose and 
    debug modes are off.
  * Fixed CVTDATE function to correctly process deltas containing negative
    months.
  * Fixed SET PRINTER /CHARACTER-SET:<cs> to assign the specified character
    set to the printer.  Previously attempts to set the character set would
    always result in Danish ASCII being assigned instead of the desired 
    character-set.  Printer output of non-ASCII characters will be output
    as question marks instead.
  * Fixed --title: command line option to make the behavior equivalent to
    the SET TITLE command.
  * Fixed the dialer to only generate SET LOGIN PROMPT and SET LOGIN 
    PASSWORD output strings if the user provided a value in the dialer
    field.
  * Added --noclose command line option to disable the File->Exit menu
    item and remove the System Menu Close menu item
  * Fixed writing to the VTxxx Status Line when the cursor in the display
    region is located on the right most margin.
  * Fixed the parsing of \K{verb} to be an alias for \Kverb.  
  * Fixed processing of VT control character.
  * Removed restriction on use of auto wrap mode when DECCOLM is set.
  * OpenSSL has been updated to close known security holes (0.9.8)
  * Dialer View->FTP option fixed to prevent displaying non-FTP items
  * -q (quiet) command line option suppresses all startup text allowing
    the connection to be used for stdio redirection of data over ssh.
  * SHOW TERMINAL did not display the status of "SET TERM ATTRIBUTE DIM"
  * DNS SRV record lookups for SSH did not work if a service name was not
    specified.
  * Fixed HTTP POST to not insert extra blank line after headers
  * Fixed parsing of SSH GLOBAL-KNOWN-HOSTS-FILE and USER-KNOWN-HOSTS-FILE
  * Default terminal type changed to VT220 because Solaris and Linux 
    variations no longer include definitions for VT320
  * Dialer Status line only updates the value if it changes.

Kermit 95 includes all modifications made by Columbia University to C-Kermit.
C-Kermit modifications are usually incorporated into the build the same day
Columbia University releases them.
